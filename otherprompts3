The CI/CD pipeline failed for commit 512694f due to the Infrastructure.Tests compilation errors. Since those test files are incomplete work-in-progress and not related to my Epic 1 Phase 3 changes, I need to either:

  1. Fix the GitHub Actions workflow to skip building Infrastructure.Tests
  2. Or exclude those problematic files from the project

Option 1: Continue with Azure Configuration (Days 4-5)
  - I can guide you through configuring Facebook, Google, and Apple providers in Azure Entra External ID portal
  - Test the idp claim mapping for each provider
  - Verify multi-provider login works end-to-end

  Option 2: Move to Epic 2 - Event Discovery & Management
  - Epic 2 Phase 1: Event Location with PostGIS (3 days)
  - Epic 2 Phase 2: Event Images (2 days)
  - Ready to start immediately - no blockers

  Option 3: Frontend Development
  - Frontend Phase 1: Authentication UI (registration, login, profile)
  - Frontend Phase 2: Event discovery and management UI
  - Requires backend APIs complete (which they are for Epic 1)

  Deferred (Future Enhancement):

  - ⏸️ Event Recommendations - Requires ML infrastructure and user behavior data (TBD)
 ------------------------------------------
🎯 Your Priority Order:

  1. Epic 1 Phase 4 - Email verification & password reset (3-4 days)
    - SendEmailVerificationCommand + Handler
    - SendPasswordResetCommand + Handler
    - Email service integration (SendGrid/MailHog)
  2. Frontend Development - Epic 1 & Epic 2 UI (4-5 weeks)
    - Authentication UI (registration, login, profile)
    - Event Discovery & Management UI
  3. Epic 1 Phase 2 (Days 4-5) - Social login Azure config (2 days)
    - Configure Facebook/Google/Apple in Azure Entra External ID portal
    - Deploy and verify multi-provider login

  Reasoning I understand:
  - Get email verification/password reset working first (complete core auth flow)
  - Then build the frontend so users can actually use Epic 1 & Epic 2 features
  - Social login Azure config can come last (nice-to-have, not blocking)
 -------------------------------------------

 Go ahead.
  1. Don't forget to follow proper incremental TDD process (Zero Tolerance for Compilation Errors).
  2. Don't forget to consult architect when needed.
  3. Before make any code changes, make sure you are not duplicating the code by reviewing whether there are similar implemenation or some reusable componants are available.
  4. You must follow TDD and DDD patterns for development. For more details refer: c:\Work\LankaConnect\CLAUDE.md
  5. Also, update the status in c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\STREAMLINED_ACTION_PLAN.md whenever possible acording to c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\TASK_SYNCHRONIZATION_STRATEGY.md.
  7. For database migrations we should always use EF core migrations.
  8. No local DB or docker using at this time. We have a stating database and staging deployment is azure and we use deploy-staging.yml for that. But the UI is currently running locally by poiting to staging APIs

--------------------------Claude Code plan on 11/12/2025---------------------
Complete Documentation & Role Infrastructure Plan
Objective
Complete role infrastructure for all 6 user types, add disabled BusinessOwner UI placeholders, fix login/registration errors, create missing documentation, and establish prevention system.
Phase 1: Fix Backend Role Infrastructure (30 min)
1.1 Complete UserRoleExtensions.cs
File: src/LankaConnect.Domain/Users/Enums/UserRole.cs Update ToDisplayName():
UserRole.BusinessOwner => "Business Owner",
UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner => "Event Organizer + Business Owner",
Update CanCreateEvents():
return role == UserRole.EventOrganizer || 
       role == UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner ||
       role == UserRole.Admin || 
       role == UserRole.AdminManager;
Update RequiresSubscription():
return role == UserRole.EventOrganizer || 
       role == UserRole.BusinessOwner ||
       role == UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner;
Add new methods:
public static bool CanCreateBusinessProfile(this UserRole role)
{
    return role == UserRole.BusinessOwner || 
           role == UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner ||
           role == UserRole.Admin || 
           role == UserRole.AdminManager;
}

public static bool CanCreatePosts(this UserRole role)
{
    return role == UserRole.EventOrganizer || 
           role == UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner ||
           role == UserRole.Admin || 
           role == UserRole.AdminManager;
}

public static decimal GetMonthlySubscriptionPrice(this UserRole role)
{
    return role switch
    {
        UserRole.EventOrganizer => 10.00m,
        UserRole.BusinessOwner => 10.00m,
        UserRole.EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner => 15.00m,
        _ => 0.00m
    };
}
1.2 Build Backend
dotnet build --configuration Debug
Expected: 0 errors (case-insensitive JSON fix already applied)
Phase 2: Update Frontend Types (15 min)
2.1 Update auth.types.ts

  EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner = 'EventOrganizerAndBusinessOwner',
  Admin = 'Admin',
  AdminManager = 'AdminManager',
}
