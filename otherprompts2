The CI/CD pipeline failed for commit 512694f due to the Infrastructure.Tests compilation errors. Since those test files are incomplete work-in-progress and not related to my Epic 1 Phase 3 changes, I need to either:

  1. Fix the GitHub Actions workflow to skip building Infrastructure.Tests
  2. Or exclude those problematic files from the project

Option 1: Continue with Azure Configuration (Days 4-5)
  - I can guide you through configuring Facebook, Google, and Apple providers in Azure Entra External ID portal
  - Test the idp claim mapping for each provider
  - Verify multi-provider login works end-to-end

  Option 2: Move to Epic 2 - Event Discovery & Management
  - Epic 2 Phase 1: Event Location with PostGIS (3 days)
  - Epic 2 Phase 2: Event Images (2 days)
  - Ready to start immediately - no blockers

  Option 3: Frontend Development
  - Frontend Phase 1: Authentication UI (registration, login, profile)
  - Frontend Phase 2: Event discovery and management UI
  - Requires backend APIs complete (which they are for Epic 1)

  When it comes to minimal api conversion, consider these as well
  1. Fast-Endpoints vs Minimal-APIs
  2. Can we update to .Net 10?

 ------------------------------------------

 Go ahead.
  1. Don't forget to follow proper incremental TDD process (Zero Tolerance for Compilation Errors).
  2. Don't forget to consult architect when needed.
  3. Before make any code changes, make sure you are not duplicating the code by reviewing whether there are similar implemenation or some reusable componants are available.
  4. You must follow TDD and DDD patterns for development. For more details refer: c:\Work\LankaConnect\CLAUDE.md
  5. Also, update the status in c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\PROGRESS_TRACKER.md, c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\STREAMLINED_ACTION_PLAN.md whenever possible acording to c:\Work\LankaConnect\docs\TASK_SYNCHRONIZATION_STRATEGY.md.
